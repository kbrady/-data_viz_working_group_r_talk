# Data Viz Working Group R Talk
A notebook on data visualization in R for a talk in spring 2019

## Setup Steps

1. Open RStudio on your machine or choose RStudio from the "New" dropdown menu on ACCRE (it is the last option)
2. Run `install.packages("ggplot2")` and `install.packages("png")` in RStudio
3. If using ACCRE, upload the `Grammar_of_Graphics.ipynb` notebook, the `Metro_Nashville_Public_Schools_Enrollment_and_Demographics.csv` csv file, and the `nashville_map.png` image
4. At this point all the cells should run
    - You will need to go through them in order, as some refer to previous outputs
